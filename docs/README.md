## 📋 The Triple-Doc Protocol

### 1. [Product Requirements Document (PRD)](./01-prd.md)
**The "What" and "Why"** This document outlines the business case, user personas, and high-level functional requirements. It serves as the single source of truth for project scope and success metrics.

### 2. [Technical Design Document (TDD)](./02-tdd.md)
**The "How"** A deep dive into the MERN architecture. This includes:
* **Database Schema:** Mongoose models and data relationships.
* **API Specification:** Detailed RESTful endpoint mapping.
* **Frontend Architecture:** React component hierarchy and state management strategy.
* **Integrations:** Configuration details for external APIs (Google Maps, reCAPTCHA, etc.).

### 3. [Testing & Quality Assurance (UAT)](./03-uat-plan.md)
**The "Proof"** The final validation phase. This document tracks individual test cases across authentication, CRUD operations, and responsive design, complete with screenshot evidence to ensure a bug-free deployment.
